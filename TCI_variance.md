## Abstract

## Introduction
The evolution of the planktic foraminifera is controlled by their environment (e.g., Ezard et al., 2011). As key aspects of the carbon cycle (XXX), understanding how they respond to environmental catastrophies is important for our understanding of the future. Additionally, they have an incomparable fossil record, with a species-level record at the same fidelty of the best resolved genus-level macrofossil record (Ezard et al., 2011). Intervals of significantly high rates of origination and extinction coincide with
